# chrome-tab-counter

This is a chrome extension that tracks how many times you've opened a new tab and visited facebook.

I made this app after I became frustrated with how often I would find myself pressing ctrl+t face enter in Chrome whenever I had even a second of downtime. I wondered to myself how many times I did this throughout the day, and then I realized that making an extension that would track these stats would probably not be that hard. So in order to discourage my facebook usage (without actually blocking the page), I made this app.

Future updates will allow for the user to manually input the websites they'd like to track (reddit and youtube are on my personal hitlist!)
